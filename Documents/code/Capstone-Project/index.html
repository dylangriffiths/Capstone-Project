    The first thing to think about is what you might want to do. You do not have to know what you want to major in but throughout your school career you have expierenced different classes and methods of working. Reflect on your expierences and try to narrow down to at least a few categories. For instance if you always dreaded math but loved english, conisder what it would be like to delve into the field as your job. During this process it is important that you focus solely on what you enjoyed or disliked, not about what jobs you think are ones that should be pursued because they pay better.
